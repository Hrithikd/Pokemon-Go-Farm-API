# Instructions

2. Open up zip and open up command line and go to the directory where the opened zip is at. 
3. Run the following line on terminal/CMD: `pip install -r requirements.txt` If that doesn't work then just add `sudo` to the beginning and enter the password for your main computer account.
4. Then go to the configure.json file and change whatever information you need. Then go to pokebot.py and change the latitude & longitude where stated.
5. Run the following line on terminal/CMD if you login into Pokemon Go with Google: `python pokebot.py -i 0` and `python pokebot.py -i 1` if you use Pokemon Trainer's Club
6. After you run it the first time add `--cache` to the end. For example, `python pokebot.py -i 0 --cache`
